### to rename nic to eth0

first, get rid of netplan (not all versions will have it) and add in
```
ifupdown scripts
apt remove netplan
apt install ifupdown
```

```
touch /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
```

edit it, and add this line (change mac address as required)
```
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*",ATTR{address}=="02:01:02:03:04:05", ATTR{dev_id}=="0x0",ATTR{type}=="1", NAME="eth0"
```

edit /etc/network/interfaces and rename the nic to eth0

Here's what my /etc/network/interfaces looks like now
